sgd-svm is a implemention of Support vector machine train by Stochastic gradient descent.

1. Train
The input file format is:
	<label> <feature>:<value> ... <feature>:<value>
label is -1 or 1

build model:
./sgd_svm_train iteration lambda trainname modelname


2. Predict
./sgd_svm_predict modelname testfile

3. Test
sh run.sh
